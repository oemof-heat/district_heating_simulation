"""
Create a district heating network from OpenStreetMap data,
and perform a DHS Investment Optimisation.
Based on the routing and dimensioning of the optimisation, a pandapipes
model is generated for the detailed thermo-hydraulic calculation for
checking the feasibility of the suggested design of the optimisation.

# # Part I: Get and prepare the input data for the optimisation

# ## a) Geometry of potential routes and buildings

# ### Get OSM data

# If you do not have any geo-referenced data, you can obtain the footprints
# and the street network as potential routes for the DHS from OpenStreetMaps.
# This is done with the library osmnx.

# Alternatively, you can of course use your individual GIS data.
# With geopandas, you can easily import different formats as .shp, .geojson
# or other GIS formats.
# The workflow could also use the OSM data as starting point,
# then you could manually edit the geometries, e.g. in QGIS,
# and the import them again in your Python script with geopandas.

# For getting the OSM data, first, select the street types you want to
# consider as routes for the district heating network.
# see also: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway

streets = dict({
    'highway': [
        'residential',
        'service',
        'unclassified',
    ]
})

# And also select the building types you want to import
# see: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building

buildings = dict({
    'building': [
        'apartments',
        'commercial',
        'detached',
        'house',
        'industrial',
        'residential',
        'retail',
        'semidetached_house'
    ]
})

# Then, define a bounding box polygon from a list of lat/lon coordinates, that
# contains the district you are considering.

bbox = [(9.1008896, 54.1954005),
        (9.1048374, 54.1961024),

        ]
polygon = geometry.Polygon(bbox)

# With osmnx we can convert create a graph from the street network and
# plot this with the plotting function of osmnx

graph = ox.graph_from_polygon(polygon, network_type='drive_service')
ox.plot_graph(graph)

# Next, we create geopandas dataframes with the footprints of the buildings
# (polygon geometries) and also for the street network, which are line
# geometries

gdf_poly_houses = ox.geometries_from_polygon(polygon, tags=buildings)
gdf_lines_streets = ox.geometries_from_polygon(polygon, tags=streets)

# We need to make sure that only polygon geometries are used

)].copy()

# Remove nodes column (that make somehow trouble for exporting .geojson)

gdf_poly_houses.drop(columns=['nodes'], inplace=True)
gdf_lines_streets.drop(columns=['nodes'], inplace=True)

# We need one (or more) buildings that we call "generators", that represent
# the heat supply facility. In this example, we randomly choose one of the
# buildings and put it to a new GeoDataFrame. Of course, in your project,
# you need to import a geopandas DataFrame with you heat supply sites.

np.random.seed(42)
id_generator = np.random.randint(len(gdf_poly_houses))
gdf_poly_gen = gdf_poly_houses.iloc[[id_generator]].copy()
gdf_poly_houses.drop(index=gdf_poly_houses.index[id_generator], inplace=True)

# The houses need a maximum thermal power. For this example, we set it
# to a random value between 10 and 50 kW for all houses.
# Note: You can also provide the heat demand as demand time series.

gdf_poly_houses['P_heat_max'] = \
    np.random.randint(10, 50, size=len(gdf_poly_houses))

# Now, let's plot the given geometry with matplotlib

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
gdf_lines_streets.plot(ax=ax, color='blue')
gdf_poly_gen.plot(ax=ax, color='orange')

plt.title('Geometry before processing')
plt.show()

# You can optionally export the geometry (e.g. for QGIS) as follows:

# gdf_poly_houses.to_file('footprint_buildings.geojson', driver='GeoJSON')

# ### Process the geometry for DHNx

# Note: if you use your individual geometry layers, you must make sure, that
# the geometries of the lines are line geometries. And the geometries of the
# buildings and generators are either polygon or point geometries.

# if you are using your individual geometries,
# load your geopandas DataFrames:

# gdf_lines_streets = gpd.read_file('your_file.geojson')
# gdf_poly_gen = gpd.read_file('your_file.geojson')
# gdf_poly_houses = gpd.read_file('your_file.geojson')

# The next step is the processing of the geometries with DHNx.
# This function connects the consumers and producers to the line network
# by creating the connection lines to the buildings,
# and sets IDs for each building/segment.
# For connecting the polygons (in case you have polygons) to the street
# network, you can choose between two methods: connect to the midpoint of the
# polygon, or to the boundary of the polygon.

tn_input = process_geometry(
    lines=gdf_lines_streets,
    producers=gdf_poly_gen,
    consumers=gdf_poly_houses,
    method="boundary",  # select the method of how to connect the buildings
)

# The result of the processing are a dictionary with four geoDataFrames:
# consumers, producers, pipes and forks.
# After successfully processing, we can plot the geometry after processing.

_, ax = plt.subplots()
tn_input['consumers'].plot(ax=ax, color='green')
tn_input['producers'].plot(ax=ax, color='red')
tn_input['pipes'].plot(ax=ax, color='blue')
tn_input['forks'].plot(ax=ax, color='grey')
plt.title('Geometry after processing')
plt.show()

# Optionally export the geo dataframes and load it into QGIS or any other GIS
# Software for checking the results of the processing.

# path_geo = 'qgis'
# for key, val in tn_input.items():
#     val.to_file(os.path.join(path_geo, key + '.geojson'), driver='GeoJSON')


# ## b) Pre-calculate the hydraulic parameter

# Besides the geometries, we need the techno-economic data for the
# investment optimisation of the DHS piping network. Therefore, we load
# the pipes data table. This is the information you need to get from your
# manufacturer / from your project.



# Part III: Initialise the ThermalNetwork and perform the Optimisation #######

# initialize a ThermalNetwork
network = ThermalNetwork()

# add the pipes, forks, consumer, and producers to the ThermalNetwork
for k, v in tn_input.items():
    network.components[k] = v

# check if ThermalNetwork is consistent
network.is_consistent()

# load the specification of the oemof-solph components
invest_opt = load_invest_options('invest_data')


# optionally, define some settings for the solver. Especially increasing the
# solution tolerance with 'ratioGap' or setting a maximum runtime in 'seconds'
# helps if large networks take too long to solve
settings = dict(solver='cbc',
                solve_kw={
                    'tee': False,  # print solver output
                },
                solver_cmdline_options={
                    # 'allowableGap': 1e-5,  # (absolute gap) default: 1e-10
                    # 'ratioGap': 0.2,  # (0.2 = 20% gap) default: 0
                    # 'seconds': 60 * 1,  # (maximum runtime) default: 1e+100
                },
                )

# perform the investment optimisation
network.optimize_investment(invest_options=invest_opt, **settings)


# Part IV: Check the results #############

# get results

print(results_edges[['costs']].sum())
print('Objective value: ', network.results.optimization['oemof_meta']['objective'])
# (The costs of the objective value and the investment costs of the DHS
# pipelines are the same, since no additional costs (e.g. for energy sources)
# are considered in this example.)

# add the investment results to the geoDataFrame
gdf_pipes = network.components['pipes']
gdf_pipes = gdf_pipes.join(results_edges, rsuffix='results_')

# plot output after processing the geometry
