# # Part I: Get and prepare the input data for the optimisation

# ## a) Geometry of potential routes and buildings

# ### Get OSM data

# If you do not have any geo-referenced data, you can obtain the footprints
# and the street network as potential routes for the DHS from OpenStreetMaps.
# This is done with the library osmnx.

# Alternatively, you can of course use your individual GIS data.
# With geopandas, you can easily import different formats as .shp, .geojson
# or other GIS formats.
# The workflow could also use the OSM data as starting point,
# then you could manually edit the geometries, e.g. in QGIS,
# and the import them again in your Python script with geopandas.

# For getting the OSM data, first, select the street types you want to
# consider as routes for the district heating network.
# see also: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway

streets = dict({
    'highway': [
        'residential',
        'service',
        'unclassified',
    ]
})

# And also select the building types you want to import
# see: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building

buildings = dict({
    'building': [
        'apartments',
        'commercial',
        'detached',
        'house',
        'industrial',
        'residential',
        'retail',
        'semidetached_house'
    ]
})

# Then, define a bounding box polygon from a list of lat/lon coordinates, that
# contains the district you are considering.

bbox = [(9.1008896, 54.1954005),
        (9.1048374, 54.1961024),
        (9.1090996, 54.1906397),
        (9.1027474, 54.1895923),
        ]
polygon = geometry.Polygon(bbox)

# With osmnx we can convert create a graph from the street network and
# plot this with the plotting function of osmnx

graph = ox.graph_from_polygon(polygon, network_type='drive_service')
ox.plot_graph(graph)

# Next, we create geopandas dataframes with the footprints of the buildings
# (polygon geometries) and also for the street network, which are line
# geometries

gdf_poly_houses = ox.geometries_from_polygon(polygon, tags=buildings)
gdf_lines_streets = ox.geometries_from_polygon(polygon, tags=streets)

# We need to make sure that only polygon geometries are used

    lambda x: isinstance(x, geometry.Polygon)
)].copy()

# Remove nodes column (that make somehow trouble for exporting .geojson)

gdf_poly_houses.drop(columns=['nodes'], inplace=True)
gdf_lines_streets.drop(columns=['nodes'], inplace=True)

# We need one (or more) buildings that we call "generators", that represent
# the heat supply facility. In this example, we randomly choose one of the
# buildings and put it to a new GeoDataFrame. Of course, in your project,
# you need to import a geopandas DataFrame with you heat supply sites.

np.random.seed(42)
id_generator = np.random.randint(len(gdf_poly_houses))
gdf_poly_gen = gdf_poly_houses.iloc[[id_generator]].copy()

# The houses need a maximum thermal power. For this example, we set it
# to a random value between 10 and 50 kW for all houses.
# Note: You can also provide the heat demand as demand time series.

    np.random.randint(10, 50, size=len(gdf_poly_houses))

plt.title('Geometry before processing')
plt.show()

# You can optionally export the geometry (e.g. for QGIS) as follows:

# gdf_poly_houses.to_file('footprint_buildings.geojson', driver='GeoJSON')

# ### Process the geometry for DHNx

# Note: if you use your individual geometry layers, you must make sure, that
# the geometries of the lines are line geometries. And the geometries of the
# buildings and generators are either polygon or point geometries.

# if you are using your individual geometries,
# load your geopandas DataFrames:

# gdf_lines_streets = gpd.read_file('your_file.geojson')
# gdf_poly_gen = gpd.read_file('your_file.geojson')
# gdf_poly_houses = gpd.read_file('your_file.geojson')

# The next step is the processing of the geometries with DHNx.
# This function connects the consumers and producers to the line network
# by creating the connection lines to the buildings,
# and sets IDs for each building/segment.
# For connecting the polygons (in case you have polygons) to the street
# network, you can choose between two methods: connect to the midpoint of the
# polygon, or to the boundary of the polygon.

tn_input = process_geometry(
    lines=gdf_lines_streets,
    producers=gdf_poly_gen,
    consumers=gdf_poly_houses,
    method="boundary",  # select the method of how to connect the buildings
)

# The result of the processing are a dictionary with four geoDataFrames:
# consumers, producers, pipes and forks.
# After successfully processing, we can plot the geometry after processing.

_, ax = plt.subplots()
tn_input['consumers'].plot(ax=ax, color='green')
tn_input['producers'].plot(ax=ax, color='red')
tn_input['pipes'].plot(ax=ax, color='blue')
tn_input['forks'].plot(ax=ax, color='grey')
plt.title('Geometry after processing')
plt.show()

# Optionally export the geo dataframes and load it into QGIS or any other GIS
# Software for checking the results of the processing.

# path_geo = 'qgis'
# for key, val in tn_input.items():
#     val.to_file(os.path.join(path_geo, key + '.geojson'), driver='GeoJSON')


# ## b) Pre-calculate the hydraulic parameter

# Besides the geometries, we need the techno-economic data for the
# investment optimisation of the DHS piping network. Therefore, we load
# the pipes data table. This is the information you need from your
# manufacturer / from your project.

df_pipe_data = pd.read_csv("input/Pipe_data.csv", sep=",")
print(df_pipe_data.head(n=8))

# This is an example of input data. The Roughness refers to the roughness of
# the inner surface and depends on the material (steel, plastic). The U-value
# and the costs refer to the costs of the whole pipeline trench, so including
# forward and return pipelines. The design process of DHNx is based on
# a maximum pressure drop per meter as design criteria:

df_pipe_data["Maximum pressure drop [Pa/m]"] = 150

# You could also define the maximum pressure drop individually for each DN
# number.

# As further assumptions, you need to estimate the operation temperatures of
# the district heating network in the design case:

df_pipe_data["T_forward [C]"] = 80
df_pipe_data["T_return [C]"] = 50
df_pipe_data["T_level [C]"] = 65

# Based on that pressure drop, the maximum transport capacity (mass flow) is
# calculated for each DN number.

# First, the maximum flow velocity is calculated.

df_pipe_data["v_max [m/s]"] = df_pipe_data.apply(lambda row: v_max_bisection(
    d_i=row["Inner diameter [m]"],
    T_average=row["T_level [C]"],
    k=row['Roughness [mm]'],
    p_max=row["Maximum pressure drop [Pa/m]"]), axis=1)

# Then, the maximum mass flow:

df_pipe_data['Mass flow [kg/s]'] = df_pipe_data.apply(
    lambda row: calc_mass_flow(
        v=row['v_max [m/s]'],
        di=row["Inner diameter [m]"],
        T_av=row["T_level [C]"]), axis=1,
)

# Finally, the maximum thermal transport capacity of each DN pipeline trench
# in kW is calculated based on the design temperatures of the DHS:

df_pipe_data['P_max [kW]'] = df_pipe_data.apply(
    lambda row: 0.001 * calc_power(
        T_vl=row['T_forward [C]'],
        T_rl=row['T_return [C]'],
        mf=row['Mass flow [kg/s]']), axis=1,
)

# Furthermore, the thermal loss of ech DN number per meter is calculated
# (based on the design temperatures of the district heating network):

temperature_ground = 10

df_pipe_data['P_loss [kW]'] = df_pipe_data.apply(
    lambda row: 0.001 * calc_pipe_loss(
        temp_average=row["T_level [C]"],
        u_value=row["U-value [W/mK]"],
        temp_ground=temperature_ground,
    ), axis=1,
)

# The last step is the linearisation of the cost  and loss parameter for the
# DHNx optimisation (which is based on the MILP optimisation package
# oemof-solph)

# It is possible to use different accuracies: you could linearize the cost
# and loss values with 1 segment, or many segment, or you can also perform
# an optimisation with discrete DN numbers (which is of course computationally
# more expensive). See also the DHNx example "discrete_DN_numbers"

# Here follows a linear approximation with 1 segment

constants_costs = np.polyfit(
    df_pipe_data['P_max [kW]'], df_pipe_data['Costs [eur]'], 1,
)
constants_loss = np.polyfit(
    df_pipe_data['P_max [kW]'], df_pipe_data['P_loss [kW]'], 1,
)

print('Costs constants: ', constants_costs)
print('Loss constants: ', constants_loss)

# Let's plot the economic assumptions:

x_min = df_pipe_data['P_max [kW]'].min()
x_max = df_pipe_data['P_max [kW]'].max()
y_min = constants_costs[0] * x_min + constants_costs[1]
y_max = constants_costs[0] * x_max + constants_costs[1]

_, ax = plt.subplots()
x = df_pipe_data['P_max [kW]']
y = df_pipe_data['Costs [eur]']
ax.plot(x, y, lw=0, marker="o", label="DN numbers",)
ax.plot(
    [x_min, x_max], [y_min, y_max],
    ls=":", color='r', marker="x"
)
ax.set_xlabel("Transport capacity [kW]")
ax.set_ylabel("Kosten [â¬/m]")

# The next step is the creation of the input dataframe with the techno-economic
